Two main files that will be helpful to guide through the files would be :
- _File-Names and Summary  (this is a pdf file with a guide to which file is which and the tried approaches, this is more or less full approach along with the notebook comments.) 
-_MAIN.html (this is the code notebook, with comments on what each cell does and why it is there.)
